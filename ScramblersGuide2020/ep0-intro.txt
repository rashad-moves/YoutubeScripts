Video Script

My name's Rashad Chowdhury.  We'll be covering the Scrambler's Guide to Nogi Jiu Jitsu. Jiu Jitsu being a sport of submission grappling. Nogi, meaning without a gi you can grab onto. Since, I'm more passionate about nogi at the moment, that's what we'll be covering.

Scrambles are moments where there's no secured position and therefore, much uncertainty to what the next position will be and who will secure the next dominant position.  I often allow and encourage scrambles. Because of this, people tell me I'm "good at the scramble."  Sometimes, I get the impression people tell me this with the belief that I'm lucky or just really athletic. But actually, there's a bunch of thought process to how I succeed in scrambles. This series is to illuminate that thought process, so you too can succeed in scrambles.  

That's not to put me on a pedestal. I'm not that good. Feel free to look at my competition footage and come to your own conclusion on how good I am. I try to be as transparent as possible by uploading my competition footage.

One of the big reasons I want to produce this series is because I learned alot from watching free Youtube videos. I want to encourage that information spreading.

I'm very light in the details, so if there's anything you want to see specifically, do comment. Also, comment if you ever hit this stuff, why you're watching. E.g, are you a bjj guy and this stuff is unfamiliar to you or you used to wrestle and this stuff is up your alley? I have a small channel, so I'll be doing my best to respond to all q's.

If you learned something, do like the video, I appreciate it.

Subscibe if you want to see more from me.
