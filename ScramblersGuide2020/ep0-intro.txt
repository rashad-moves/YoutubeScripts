My name's Rashad Chowdhury.  Im filming from CTA Alexandria BJJ. I used to wrestle in HS from TC Williams. I chose this gym as I found the culture very open minded to letting me learn new things and experiment.  The stuff we'll be covering in this series isn't what's typically taught here. Coach Vu teaches traditional BJJ with leg locks too. You can see more of that in the @cta_alexandria_bjj instagram.  I'll be covering more so a wrestlers / mma centric approach to mma.  

My game is heavily based on going for something and if you get it, awesome. If not, instead of grinding to make it work, transition to something else based on how they defended, what their reaciton was.

To give a specific example, if I go for a double leg and they sprawl, the old school way I learned in HS was just drive. Who cares if they sprawl, go right through it.  It's great for developing your mental. If you really want your takedown, you'll get it with that mindset. But given the option, I'd much rather transition to a duck step if they sprawl.

I picked up many of these moves from free videos on Youtube. This is my way of giving back to the online communityand promoting that culture of information spreading.

I'm very light in the details, so if there's anything you want to see specifically, do comment. Also, comment if you ever hit this stuff, why you're watching. E.g, are you a bjj guy and this stuff is unfamiliar to you or you used to wrestle and this stuff is up your alley? I have a small channel, so I'll be doing my best to respond to all q's.

If you learned something, do like the video, I appreciate it.

Subscibe if you want to see more from me.
