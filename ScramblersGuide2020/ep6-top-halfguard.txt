3) navy ride
  1) patella lock
  2) banana split pass
3) belly them down for calf slicer
  1) rnc with the leg captured (top crab)
4) they try coming up to defend legs (assuming no kneeshield, at the very least, your navy ride can help clear that)
  1) as they're trying to get underhook, fall on that arm for reverse kesagatame. using near side arm to trap their arm to keep kimura available, far side arm pushes on knee to get knee line out (or pass if they're sleeping)

      2) knee in belly to butterfly hook mount
      3) go for gullotine
      4) non captured leg traps their top leg, roll for truck (truck roll)
  2) switch between clearing your knee line and just securing a kimura
    1) ride the kimura up their back with short explosive movements
    2) if you need to, roll forward on head, facing them so I can step my leg over their head and I end up on my back but I got a leg around their legs and a leg around their head
    3) if they're straightening their arm out, jesus kimura
    4) if they bring their arm to close to their head to finish and you're getting an americana now but with the wrong grip
      1) go for arm triangle.  secure the arm with my head and crossface arm so other arm can push on ther knee plus work the butterfly hook with non captured leg.  get to mount, slide over, finish.
5) they got the underhook, got for a 1/4 nelson (plant on their face and secure the arm) and kneeslice pass
  -if they keep their arm on the inside
