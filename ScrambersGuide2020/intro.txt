My name's Rashad Chowdhury.  Im filming from CTA Alexandria BJJ. I used to wrestle in HS from TC Williams. I chose this gym as I found the culture very open minded to letting me learn new things and experiment.  The stuff we'll be covering in this series isn't what's typically taught here. Coach Vu teaches traditional BJJ with leg locks too. You can see more of that in the cta insta.  I'll be covering more so a wrestlers / mma centric approach to mma.  

My game is heavily based on going for something and if you get it, awesome. If not, instead of grinding to make it work, transition to something else based on how he defended, what his reaciton was.

To give a specific example, if I go for a double leg and he sprawls, the old school way I learned in HS is just drive. Who cares if he sprawls, go right through it.  It's great for developing your mental. If you really want your takedown, youll get it with that mindset. But given the option, I'd much rather transition to a duck step if he sprawls.

I picked up most all of these moves from people I rolled with. I try to give back to the younger guys at the gym. And a ton of moves from free youtube videos. So this is my way of giving back to the online community.

very light in the details so if there's anything you want to see specifically, do comment. My best approach will likely to troubleshoot someone else attempting the move.  also comment if you ever hit this stuff, why you're watching eg are you a bjj guy and this stuff is unfamiliar to you or you used to wrestle and this stuff is working up your alley? i have a small channel so ill be doing my best to respond to any q's.

if you learned something, do like the video, i appreciate it.

subscibe if you want to see more from me.
